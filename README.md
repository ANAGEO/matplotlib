# Matplotlib 

This repository is dedicated to share code we used to create graph in python using matplotlib. 

It could be great if anyone could put his matplotlib code here so that other can reuse it for their work. 

If possible, please upload also the data file. That way, you code would be reproductible. 

Currently in this repo: 

- Boxplot for multiple class of interest (used in spuspo with known morphological type of local zone).

To add: 

- Feature importance for output of random forest.
- Collection of Probability Density Functions (PDF) to show the distribution of spectral values on differents classes. 
- Confusion matrix with gradient color scheme.
